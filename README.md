# html-fund-me-fcc

This repository is linked with the [hardhat-fund-me-fcc](https://github.com/Jitumani073/hardhat-fund-me-fcc)
smart contract. 

This is about an interaction between the `smart contract` and the `web interface`

---

## Requirement

* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) : This is a browser extension that lets you interact with the blockchain.

---

## Run a server
You can usually just double click the file to "run it in the browser". Or you can right click the file in your VSCode and run "open with live server".

And you should see a small button that says "connect".

Hit it, and you should see `metamask` pop up.

All the transactions are done through `metamask`. Before going to any transaction you should have the [hardhat-fund-me-fcc](https://github.com/Jitumani073/hardhat-fund-me-fcc) smart contract deployed in Testnet or Localnet
